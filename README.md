## Overview

_With ReCycler, it’s easier than you think!_

ReCycler is an open-source platform aimed at creating a more modern and user-centric recycling service, building upon the data foundation of the existing kierrätys.info. ReCycler platform leverages the kierrätys.info API (https://api.kierratys.info/) to obtain basic information about recycling collection spots. Additionally, the service utilizes Mapbox's mapping and location-based services. The idea of the platform is to provide solutions to various use cases efficiently and seamlessly.
## Features
### User-friendly interface for smart recycling guidance
ReCycler provides an intuitive interface featuring a map view that visualizes the locations of recommended recycling collection spots along with detailed information about each site.
